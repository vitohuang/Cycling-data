\f0\fs32 \cf2 Feels very slow today - cant even do 10 mph! Maybe it's my backpack now weigh 15 Kgs, it does really pull you back! Start the day with breakfast cooked by my guardian and she pack cheese and ham sandwich for lunch! Loch leven is pretty good in the morning, also found out, there is a loch fitty on the route! Managed across the forth road bridge and get around Edinburgh without lost too much time! A70 is the hardest road so far - lots continues big hills and turns, very hard to cycle, but amazing view though, so will be ideal to bring car back there. Abington is start pretty good places for the Clyde river trail - postcard picture places! There is a dedicated cycle path on B7076, it's amazing! The whole road is pretty much empty, because it's right next to motorway. Only saw two cars during the ride on B7076, and managed to get my bike to 52 mph on a downhill! To finish off stay in a really nice B &B, and offered a pint if beer!}
