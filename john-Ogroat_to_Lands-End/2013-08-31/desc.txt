Good day! Going out of Taunton to Tiverton was relatively easy - only one big hill! Then I look up in the map the straightest route is through Crediton, the road from Tiverton to Crediton is unbelievably hard - the hills are never end! Had hot bacon sandwich for lunch, the shop people is really friend, she offered me lots stuff for free. Met the group I saw 3 days ago in Lancaster, and they told me A30 is very dangerous, but that's quickly eat route, so I took it with caution. A30 is bad for cycling - not to mention all the hills, just passing by cars, side winds and turbulence from cars etc is bad enough, oh well it was quickest!
