\f0\fs32 \cf2 After 12 hours driving after work yesterday, 3 pit stops and a big breakfast at a Tesco just before John O'Groat. I finally made it to the top. Now need some quality sleep time. it's raining here! Talked to some guys doing John O'groat to Edinburgh, they said they been training for awhile and been averaging 25 mph on bike, and thinking to do in 5 day, I almost shit myself when I hear that - I can't even get to 20 mph! According to them the route I take A9 is the worst route for cycling and there was a accident there, what the fucking am I doing here!}
